# How do I approach designing software?

When designing software, I start by thinking about the overall purpose and user experience I want to achieve. I focus on visual structure, functionality, and how each element interacts within the program. For this project, I planned my 3D scene and 2D animation by sketching out layouts and identifying key objects, such as shapes, lighting, and textures. I then broke down each feature into smaller, manageable tasks. This method helps me stay organized and ensures that my designs are both visually appealing and technically functional.

# What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

Working on this project helped me strengthen my ability to design with both artistic and technical awareness. I learned how to balance color, texture, and composition while maintaining performance and functionality. I also improved my understanding of how physics and movement can make a digital environment feel more natural and engaging. Designing 3D and 2D elements together taught me how to build immersive, layered visuals that react to user input.

# What design process did you follow for your project work?

My design process began with brainstorming and research. I looked at how professional animations and visualizations organize objects and motion. Then, I moved into prototyping within the development environment, testing shapes, camera angles, and object interactions. Once I was satisfied with the layout, I refined the color palette and physics behavior to achieve a more polished final product. This iterative design process allowed me to experiment and improve my scene as I went.

# How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

The tactics I used in this project?like breaking down complex visuals into smaller components and continuously testing and adjusting?can be applied to any future software or design task. Whether I?m developing a game, an application, or a simulation, the same process of planning, testing, and refining will help me create functional and visually consistent results. I also plan to continue applying modular design and incremental improvement strategies in future work.
