# Comp Graphic and Visualization 330 

# How do I approach designing software?

When designing software, I start by thinking about the overall purpose and user experience I want to achieve. I focus on visual structure, functionality, and how each element interacts within the program. For this project, I planned my 3D scene and 2D animation by sketching out layouts and identifying key objects, such as shapes, lighting, and textures. I then broke down each feature into smaller, manageable tasks. This method helps me stay organized and ensures that my designs are both visually appealing and technically functional.

# What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

Working on this project helped me strengthen my ability to design with both artistic and technical awareness. I learned how to balance color, texture, and composition while maintaining performance and functionality. I also improved my understanding of how physics and movement can make a digital environment feel more natural and engaging. Designing 3D and 2D elements together taught me how to build immersive, layered visuals that react to user input.

# What design process did you follow for your project work?

My design process began with brainstorming and research. I looked at how professional animations and visualizations organize objects and motion. Then, I moved into prototyping within the development environment, testing shapes, camera angles, and object interactions. Once I was satisfied with the layout, I refined the color palette and physics behavior to achieve a more polished final product. This iterative design process allowed me to experiment and improve my scene as I went.

# How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

The tactics I used in this project?like breaking down complex visuals into smaller components and continuously testing and adjusting?can be applied to any future software or design task. Whether I?m developing a game, an application, or a simulation, the same process of planning, testing, and refining will help me create functional and visually consistent results. I also plan to continue applying modular design and incremental improvement strategies in future work.

# How do I approach developing programs?

When developing programs, I approach the work step-by-step, starting with the basic structure and then layering in more complexity. I focus on writing clean, readable, and modular code so that each part of the program can be easily understood and reused. I also make sure to test frequently while coding, which helps catch bugs early and keeps development efficient. I see programming as both a creative and logical process?it?s about solving problems while building something visually meaningful.

# What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

For my 3D scene, I used several new development strategies. I applied object-oriented programming principles to organize my classes, which made it easier to control multiple objects and behaviors. I also used iterative rendering, lighting adjustments, and texture mapping to enhance realism. Implementing these techniques helped me gain confidence working with transformations, object hierarchies, and collision detection in a 3D environment.

# How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration played a crucial role throughout my development process. I continuously tested and refined the program to fine-tune object placement, motion, and visual balance. Each round of testing revealed new ways to improve the overall performance and appearance of the scene. Making small, consistent adjustments helped me build a smoother and more cohesive final animation. This approach reinforced the importance of persistence and gradual refinement when working on complex programming projects.

# How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project?s completion?

As I progressed through each milestone, my approach to coding became more organized and deliberate. At first, my focus was mainly on achieving functionality. Over time, I began emphasizing structure, clarity, and maintainability in my code. I learned to divide my logic into smaller, reusable functions and classes, which made my program easier to debug and expand. This shift helped me develop cleaner, more efficient code and a stronger understanding of how to design scalable programs.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science gives me the analytical tools and technical foundation to reach both my academic and career goals. It helps me think critically, solve complex problems, and create efficient solutions. Beyond the technical side, it also empowers me to express creativity through programming and design. The skills I?ve gained allow me to explore innovative technologies, build my own digital projects, and move confidently toward a future in the tech and design industries.

# How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

From a professional standpoint, computational graphics and visualization have given me hands-on experience in building interactive, visually appealing digital content. These skills are highly relevant to careers in game design, software development, simulation, and user interface design. Understanding how to combine logic, physics, and art to create dynamic visuals prepares me for real-world projects where creativity and technical precision must work together. This project strengthened both my technical ability and my confidence in applying these concepts professionally.
